ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan! I'm a software engineer at NVIDIA. Previously at Square, Aurora, Dropbox,
Google, Amazon, Bottle Rocket, and a couple others.

Most of my work and professional interests revolve around developer productivity tools, 
especially things like Bazel, VSCode, and other common workflow items. Mostly, I want
to make developers move faster and have a more pleasant time while doing so.
