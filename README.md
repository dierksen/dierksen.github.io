ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan! I'm a software engineer at NVIDIA. Previously at Square, Aurora, Dropbox,
Google, Amazon, Bottle Rocket, and a couple others.

I'm primarily interested in developer productivity tools, especially things like Bazel, VSCode, 
and other common workflow items. Mostly, I want to make developers move faster and have a more
pleasant time while doing so.
